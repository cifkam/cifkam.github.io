I am a Ph.D. student in the Intelligent Machine Perception group with the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics ([CIIRC, CTU Prague](https://www.ciirc.cvut.cz/)) under the supervision of [Josef Šivic](https://people.ciirc.cvut.cz/~sivic/). I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Visual Computing at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague ([MFF, CUNI](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/)) in 2024. My research interests include 6D pose estimation and object detection in an uncontrolled environment.
